A simple rock paper scissors game developed with HTML, CSS, and JS.





## Phase 1

- Team Name: **Bug Off**.
- Project Title: **V.S. Rock-Paper-Scissors**
- Original Description:
    - On our site, a user will be able to play a game of rock-paper-scissors against a bot. To play users will have to pick from three images for rock paper or scissors. Once an option is selected, the site will display the option the bot has picked. Afterwards, the choices by both sides are compared and a winner will be determined. When the game is finished, the user will have the choice to play another round or end the current session. If the user chooses to continue, another round of the game is run. If not, the wins and losses of the user for the current session are displayed. 

    - The general layout of the site will be as follows. When a user first loads the site a game is immediately started. In the middle of the page, the options for rock paper or scissors will be displayed as pictures. The user will be able to choose one of these, once clicked the option will be highlighted by a border and the user will be asked to confirm their selection. After a match has finished the user will be prompted by a pop-up to either continue or end the session. Additionally, during a session, the number of games won, lost, and total played will be shown on the left side of the page.
