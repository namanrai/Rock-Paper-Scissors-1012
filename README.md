## Phase 0

- Team Name: **Bug Off**.
- Project Title: **V.S. Rock-Paper-Scissors**
- Original Description:
    - On our site, a user will be able to play a game of rock-paper-scissors against a bot. To play users will have to pick from three images for rock paper or scissors. Once an option is selected, the site will display the option the bot has picked. Afterwards, the choices by both sides are compared and a winner will be determined. When the game is finished, the user will have the choice to play another round or end the current session. If the user chooses to continue, another round of the game is run. If not, the wins and losses of the user for the current session are displayed.
